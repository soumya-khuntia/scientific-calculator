# Scientific Calculator 
- For check out click here :- [Scientific_Calculator](https://soumya-khuntia.github.io/scientific-calculator) .

This is a simple scientific calculator web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Calculates exponents and roots  
- Computes trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, tangent
- Calculates logarithms and factorials
- Supports radians and degrees for trigonometric functions
- Has a clean, simple UI with large calculator-style buttons

## Implementation 

- The UI is implemented using HTML and CSS
- JavaScript is used to add interactivity and implement the calculator logic 
- When calculator buttons are clicked, the corresponding JavaScript functions are invoked
- The `eval()` function is used to evaluate the mathematical expression entered
- Custom functions are defined for advanced operations like logs, factorials etc.  
- Trigonometric functions use the Math library and convert between radians and degrees
- The UI updates dynamically using the DOM manipulation capability of JavaScript

## Usage

The calculator is easy to use. Simply click the buttons to enter numbers and operations. The result is dynamically calculated and displayed as you go. Press 'AC' to clear the display. Use the 'Ans' button to use the previous result in next calculation. 

Some example calculations you can perform:

- Basic arithmetic: 12 + 5 - 3 * 2
- Exponents: 2^3
- Roots: sqrt(9) 
- Logarithms: log(100)
- Factorials: 5!
- Trigonometry: sin(45) cos(60) tan(30)

## Future Improvements

Some ways the calculator could be improved in the future:

- Add scientific constants like pi, e etc  
- Implement more math functions like absolute, modulus etc.
- Improve the UI/UX for a smoother experience
- Add keyboard support for entering expressions  
- Allow parentheses in expressions to control order of operations
- Implement memory functions like MC, MR, M+ etc.
- Make the calculator responsive for mobile devices

Overall, this project gave good practice for web development using core HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. Building a calculator covers many programming concepts like functions, DOM manipulation, handling user input and more.
